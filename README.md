# Foundational Guidelines of NFDI4Microbiota 

![NFDI4Microbiota Logo](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/assets/img/nfdi4microbiota_Logo_new.png)

The mission of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium is to be the central hub in Germany for supporting the microbiology community with access to data, analysis services, data/metadata standards, and training. 

The foundational guidelines outlined in this repository are followed by NFDI4Microbiota partners and participants to foster open science with best practices and promoting [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

The guidelines will be progressively iterated upon in future versions to accomondate the goals of the consortium and improve harmonization with other consortia.
